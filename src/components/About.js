            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                2021 electrical engineering graduate, my career thus far has been as a defense travel coordinator.
                I am currently working hard building my portfolio to earn a blockchain engineering career transition.
                In the future I want to make an impact on the world by developing powerful tools which support a decentralized global society,
                fighting against authoritarian technological creep.
